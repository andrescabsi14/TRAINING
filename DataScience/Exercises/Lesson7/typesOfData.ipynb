    "    Discrete data\n",
    "      Integer based. Often count some event.\n",

    "      Has an infinite number of possible values \n",

    "Categorical\n",
    "    Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning\n",

    "    You can assign numbers to categories in order to represent them more compactly, but the numbers don't have mathematical meaning.\n",
    "Ordinal\n",
    "    - A mixture of numerical and categorical.\n",
    "    - Categorical data that has mathematical meaning.\n",
    "        Ex: Ratings must be 1,2,3,4 or 5\n",
    "        But these values have mathematical meaning; 1 means it's a worse movie than a 2."
